## üéØ **Query Types Recognition**

Here's how the system categorizes different query patterns:

### **Single Document** ‚Üí Standard two-stage search
- Contains one specific document name
- General topic without comparisons
- Direct information extraction

### **Comparison** ‚Üí Parallel search + synthesis
- Contains "compare", "difference", "versus"
- Mentions multiple specific documents
- Asks about variations between items

### **Multi-Document** ‚Üí Sequential search + synthesis
- Uses "all", "across", "common", "typical"
- Asks about patterns or summaries
- Requires information from multiple sources

### **General** ‚Üí Fallback to standard search
- Broad questions without specific documents
- Requests for general information
- Questions that don't fit other categories

## üí° **Tips for Effective Queries**

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Be Specific**: Use exact document names when known
2. **Use Keywords**: Include relevant terms like "termination", "liability", "fees"
3. **Ask Comparative Questions**: The system excels at comparisons
4. **Follow Up**: Use conversation context for deeper analysis

### **Document Name Formats:**
- Use full names: "CHASE AFFILIATE AGREEMENT" 
- Include key identifiers: "Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. Franchise Agreement"
- Be consistent with capitalization as it appears in documents

### **Comparison Query Structure:**
```
"Compare [Document A] and [Document B]"
"What are the differences between [Document A] and [Document B]?"
"How do [Document A] and [Document B] differ in terms of [specific aspect]?"
```

## üêõ **Debug Mode Examples**
